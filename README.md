# Collager ✂️

Half the fun of traditional collaging is creating something out of a limited supply of content from magazines. Collager aims to help reproduce that creative challenge by limiting the unlimited photo resources on the internet.

Collager is a simple React application that interacts with the Unsplash API. It is deployed using Github pages.
